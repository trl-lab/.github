# Welcome to the GitHub page of the Table Representation Learning (TRL) Lab ✨!

We are an academic research lab at CWI in Amsterdam. The objective of our research is to democratize insights from particularly tabular data, which holds valuable insights. To this end, we study table representation learning, generative models for tabular data, table retrieval mechanisms, tabular reasoning methods, predictive tabular ML, agentic tabular data science, and beyond. This involves contributions in machine learning, databases, information retrieval, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction topics.

You can read more about our research and lab members at: https://trl-lab.github.io/.

Here, we will share mainly code artifacts accompanying our research on TRL.
