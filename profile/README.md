# Welcome to the GitHub page of the Table Representation Learning (TRL) Lab ✨!

We are an academic research lab at CWI in Amsterdam. Our research is focused on representation learning and generative models for structured data, typically relational tables, with the objective to democratize insights from structured data. Our research spans machine learning, databases, information retrieval, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction topics.

You can read more about our research and lab members at: https://trl-lab.github.io/.

Here, we will share mainly code artifacts accompanying our research on TRL.
